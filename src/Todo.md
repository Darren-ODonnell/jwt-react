todo:

+ Get login/logout functionality working correctly
+ Admin and Coach should be able to login to desktop app.
+ Verify app works in Work,

# Errors

    E41: App does not logout after token has timed out.
         after timeout - delete old token - logout user - switch to loggedOutrNavbar
    E44: Should not be able to login as a User - only Admin allowed.
    E57: Fix app login to check that the token is good first.

    R3: Build up AuthService to include login/logout/register etc
        moved all the auth related functions into AuthService
    E7: Logout not working
        added code to routes, navbar and AuthService 
    C4: Add Reports MenuDropDownItem (PlayerStats and TeamStats dummy placegHolders for now)
        added code to routes and navbar for same
    R4: Move all references to localStorage to AuthService
        localStorage is used to store User and Token - all part of Authorisation
    E1. Login form appears with LoggedOutNavBar - change behaviour - just show logged out navbar - let user pick what action to take
        extra "/" included in route caused this to occur.
    E2. After login the clubs list appears - change behaviour - as above but showing loggedIn navbar
        window.location was set to CLUB_LIST - changed to "/"
    E8: R4 caused errors
        string passed rather than an object
    E9: After login - system repeatedly attempts to login - spring continuous streams - browser 
        call to getClubs removed from NavBarSelect. (unclear how this caused the fault!)
    I5: getClubs causes FormDialog to be called 4 times - Not a problem
        it re-renders each time state is changed, once data is changed it returns.
    U4: auth/LoginSuccess, auth/LoginFailure 
        - deleted - files were empty anyway
    E10: Foreign key details not display on any entity
        All the data has been captured from the server.
        Redo the columns for these tables
        data2 created - could not change the state variable data.
    E4. Add Entity not working for any entity - add api code to achieve same
        When adding a colDef, the ettribute field was omitted
    I6: Check useForm (from react-hook-form) for form handling ratherv than grid
        Abandoned - found fault with existing grid/form
    E3. Update form not populated with row data
        used props.data.field to access field name  
        s/b props.data[props.field]
    E13: After fixing E3 - Add New record now shows row data.
    R6: Reduce the number of export const objects ... like R5
        Url constants now grouped by Entity eg CLUB_LIST -> CLUB_URLS.list
        Only one import needed rather than multiple
    R5: Dont export getRequests from ApiRequests, use as const and refer by ApiService.getRequest...
    U6: StatService
        Deleted
    R7: Removed all compile warnings
        Either commented out (in Helper) or deleted.

    E20: Foreign key data broken after axios call changes Teamsheets
        function called gridLoader added to teamsheets.js
        additional variable called gridloader addered to teamsheetData object
        buiddata removed from teamsheetservice. (no longer required) 
    E21: 'No rows to show' appears instead on Loading - when calling for rows from server
        Used thre loading state variable to controll what is rendered. loading ? <rendered stuff> : <loading message>;
    E20: Foreign key data broken after axios call changes Events
        created new method inside each of the entriry data files ( gridLoader() )
    E5: Tables with foreign key data are not displayed correctly 
        - Teamsheets -Done
        - Fixtures - Done 
    U16: All <Entity>List.js/css components removed...
        ClubList.js/css
        CompetitionList.js/css
        FixtureList.js/css
        FirstnameList.js/css
        LastnameList.js/css
        PlayersList.js/css
        - folders tidied up
    E23: aria-query used by ag-grid using a tag which the linter/react does not know about 
        Warning: Invalid aria prop `aria-description` on <div> tag. For details, see https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-aria-props
        at div
            This is caused by aria-query version being ahead of ag-grid - the linter does not know about 'aria-description'
            fix All ag-grid imports set to exact version rather than at least (^) and not the latest which is 27.3.0
        package.json before changes
        "@ag-grid-community/client-side-row-model": "^27.2.1",
        "@ag-grid-community/csv-export": "^27.2.1",

        "ag-grid-community": "^27.2.1",
        "ag-grid-react": "^27.2.0",
        after changes (npm i run after) 
        "@ag-grid-community/client-side-row-model": "27.2.1",
        "@ag-grid-community/csv-export": "27.2.1",

    E24: Add is not working
        Postman form-data works
        Postman json does not
        trying to convert javascript to same form-data format that postman uses.
        use of FormData does not appear to work, and changes to data are not reflected in object!
        Fix: Changed spring controller to accept and Object, I was able to see what was coming in. An object within and object was 
        received. In React I changed the (in useAxios in ApiService) ...requestConfig to ...requestConfig.data, this fixed the mapping of the json data to the java object.
        Need tp go back now and fix the form-data and verify it will work.
        Record is added
    E18: Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://147.252.81.86:8080/' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS

        present on the requested resource.

        No longer an issues after change to useAxios code (E24 fix)
    E14: Attempting to call update causes a hook call violation (PostRequest())
        Although I cannot see what the issue is with the call. (error below)
        1. Uncaught Error: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM) - NO
        2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks - not as far as I know
        3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app - NO
        delete package.json.lock and node_modules - npm i - did not fix
        No longer an issues after change to useAxios code (E24 fix)
    E19: Refused to set unsafe header "Origin"

        not sure what to do with this!
        id column display removed from most grid displays except statname and pitchgrid
    E29: openTo error in Form popup
        does notaccept more than one setting openTo={'hours'}
