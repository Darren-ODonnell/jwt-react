The handleFormSubmit function receives an object as its argument and
deconstructs it. However, when calling the function, an object is not passed,
and the function should be called with an object that contains the formValues,
methods, setOpen, and error properties.

The AddData and UpdateData functions are not defined in the provided code,
which will cause errors.

There are some variables and functions that are not defined in the code,
such as TIME_FORMAT, ErrorMessage, refreshPage(), and getUniqueId().
These should be defined or removed.

In the CancelButton component, the onCancel function should be passed
as a prop to the Button component, instead of passing the props object
to the onCancel function.

In the SubmitButton component, the handleFormSubmit function should be
passed as a prop to the Button component, instead of passing the props
object to the handleFormSubmit function.

The handleDialogEnter function is defined but not used in the code,
and it can be removed.

The DialogContent component is used, but it is not clear what content
is rendered in this component, as the code does not provide any information
about the props passed to this component.

In the FormDialog component, the Cancel and Submit buttons are hard-coded
and not customizable, which limits the flexibility of the component. It would
be better to make these buttons customizable by passing them as props to the component.
